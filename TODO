Python:
    Copy all the methods of Python in Proxy in the Pythonway than operator[] and remove get()
    Move GetAttr and SetAttr to their respective functions ?
    Add more types to convert from Python (what is left ?)
    Add operator() instead of call(args, kwargs)
    For dict: change from free arguments to pairs for clarity ?
    Think about the case PyIndexProxy.operator=(PyIndexProxy)
    Round the float error and remove trailing zeros when creating name
    Disable debug name if no debug option have been enabled

Tests:
    find why -fdiagnostic-color don't output colored report
