 Copy all the methods of Python in Proxy in the Pythonway than operator[] and remove get()
 Move GetAttr and SetAttr to their respective functions ?
 Add more types to constructor, like vector, map
 Add more types to convert from Python
 Add operator() instead of call(args, kwargs)
 For dict: change from free arguments to pairs for clarity ?
 Think about the case PyIndexProxy.operator=(PyIndexProxy)
Replace string(...) by "...", float(...) by ...f, etc (make separate constructors ?)
Escape string in to_string (for visual reasons)
