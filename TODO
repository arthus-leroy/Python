Python:
    Copy all the methods of Python in Proxy in the Pythonway than operator[] and remove get()
    Move GetAttr and SetAttr to their respective functions ?
    For dict: change from free arguments to pairs for clarity ?
    Think about the case PyIndexProxy.operator=(PyIndexProxy)
    Disable debug name if no debug option have been enabled ?
    Decide on how optional should be handled (None or skipped -> skipped = work to do for containers)

Other:
    make a tool that translates native python code into c++ (except some features ?)
