Python:
    Copy all the methods of Python in Proxy
    For dict: change from free arguments to pairs for clarity ?
    Think about the case PyIndexProxy.operator=(PyIndexProxy)
    Disable debug name if no debug option have been enabled ?
    Decide on how optional should be handled (None or skipped -> skipped = work to do for containers)
    Add abs, floordiv, matmult and pow
    Add Starred support for Dict
    Optimize Python (by ungeneralyzing some things, eg. PyNumber_*/PySequence_* instead of operator module)
        -> Benchmarked a x10 difference between operator and their C equivalent

Translator:
    Make sure else block in Try/Catch is correctly implemented
    Optimize Python code (see PEP 511)
    Think about moving comprehensions' lambda into a separate function (need to keep track of names)
